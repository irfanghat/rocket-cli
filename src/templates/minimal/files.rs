/*-----------------------------------------------------------
Rocket automatically parses dynamic data in path segments into any desired type. 

This hello route has two dynamic parameters, identified with angle brackets, declared in the route URI: <name> and <age>. Rocket maps each parameter to an identically named function argument: name: &str and age: u8. The dynamic data in the incoming request is parsed automatically into a value of the argument's type. The route is called only when parsing succeeds.

Parsing is directed by the FromParam trait. Rocket implements FromParam for many standard types, including both &str and u8. You can implement it for your own types, too!
